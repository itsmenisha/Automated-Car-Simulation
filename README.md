# 🏎️ Automated-Car-Simulation NEAT using OpenAI Gym & CV2  

This project demonstrates how a car learns to navigate a track using **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)** — a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks over generations. The car’s behavior is simulated in a custom environment built with **OpenAI Gym** and **OpenCV** for visual rendering.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
The simulation evolves a population of cars to drive autonomously around a track.  
Each car uses a neural network (generated by NEAT) to interpret sensor data and decide movements.  
Over time, the best-performing cars survive and improve — eventually mastering the track without explicit training data.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- **Custom Car Environment** built with OpenCV and Gym-style interactions.  
- **NEAT-powered Evolution**: neural networks evolve to improve driving ability.  
- **Fitness Evaluation** based on distance, survival time, and efficiency.  
- **Elite Archive System**: saves top genomes across generations.  
- **Real-time Visualization** of cars learning to drive.
